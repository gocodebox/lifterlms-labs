== Description ==

LifterLMS Labs is a collection of experimental, conceptual, and possibly silly features which improve and enhance the functionality of the LifterLMS core.

We've created this free LifterLMS add-on in order to provide these optional features to the LifterLMS community which may or may not be useful to everyone.

Some labs will ultimately find their way into the LifterLMS Core, some may be a lab forever.


### Current Labs

**Action Manager**

Quickly remove specific elements like course author, syllabus, and more without having to write any code. [Documentation and more information](https://lifterlms.com/docs/lab-action-manager/?utm_source=readme&utm_medium=product&utm_campaign=lifterlmslabsplugin&utm_content=actionmanager).

**Beaver Builder**

Add LifterLMS elements as pagebuilder modules and enable row and module visibility settings based on student enrollment in courses and memberships. [Documentation and more information](https://lifterlms.com/docs/lab-beaver-builder/?utm_source=readme&utm_medium=product&utm_campaign=lifterlmslabsplugin&utm_content=beaverbuilder).


**Lifti: Divi Theme Compatibility**

Enable LifterLMS compatibility with the Divi Theme and Page Builder. [Documentation and more information](https://lifterlms.com/docs/lab-lifti/?utm_source=readme&utm_medium=product&utm_campaign=lifterlmslabsplugin&utm_content=lifti).


**Simple Branding**

Customize the default colors of various LifterLMS elements. [Documentation and more information](https://lifterlms.com/docs/simple-branding-lab?utm_source=readme&utm_campaign=lifterlmslabsplugin&utm_medium=product&utm_content=simplebranding).


**Super Sidebars**

Very quickly configure LifterLMS sidebars to work with your theme. [Documentation and more information](https://lifterlms.com/docs/super-sidebars-lab?utm_source=readme&utm_campaign=lifterlmslabsplugin&utm_medium=product&utm_content=supersidebars).
