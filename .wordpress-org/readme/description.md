LifterLMS Labs is a collection of experimental, conceptual, and possibly silly features which improve and enhance the functionality of the LifterLMS core.

We've created this free LifterLMS add-on in order to provide these optional features to the LifterLMS community which may or may not be useful to everyone.

Some labs will ultimately find their way into the LifterLMS Core, some may be a lab forever.
