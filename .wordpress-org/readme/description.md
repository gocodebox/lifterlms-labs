LifterLMS Labs is a collection of experimental features to improve and enhance the functionality of the LifterLMS core

We've created this free LifterLMS add-on plugin in order to provide these optional features to the LifterLMS community which may or may not be useful to everyone.

Some labs will ultimately find their way into the LifterLMS Core, some may remain in LifterLMS Labs.
